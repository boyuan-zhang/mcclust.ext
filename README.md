# mcclust.ext
This is an extension of the mcclust package. It provides post-processing tools for MCMC samples of partitions to summarize the posterior in Bayesian clustering models. Functions for point estimation are provided, giving a single representative clustering of the posterior. And, to characterize uncertainty in the point estimate, credible balls can be computed.

Install from GitHub with the command in R (note: first install the package devtools):

devtools::install_github(“sauravkaushik8/SamplePackage”)
